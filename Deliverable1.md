# Deliverable Information

## 1: Basic Information

**Topic you chose:** Gym Scheduling

**Sprint Number:** 1

**Scrum Master**: Kevin Somers

**Git Master**: Kevin Wilkinson

### Sprint Planning (For Sprint 1-4)
Document your Sprint Planning here. Also check the kickoff document for more details on what needs to be done. This is just the documentation. 

**Sprint Goal:** To begin to redesign the UI, using existing elements as much as possible,
towards a Gym structure as well as fixing the most significant existing bugs

**How many User Stories did you add to the Product Backlog:**  3

**How many User Stories did you add to this Sprint:** 9 in total.

> Answer the questions below about your Sprint Planning?

**Why did you add exactly these US?**

> Our goal for this sprint was to orient ourselves with the code base we're given, as well as start to target our GUI
toward the Gym Scheduler system, so we added a User Story to design the GUI for a Login screen that will be the first
screen a user sees when the program opens (after the splash image). This was chosen because it is the first contact the 
user has with the system, so it makes sense to add it during the first sprint. The User Story is meant to get a basic GUI
screen setup, and not necessarily the full functionality of logging into the system. This functionality will be added during
a later sprint.
> We also added a User Story to fix the bug with Memoranda where the program does not minimize correctly. Currently, if you
minimize Memoranda, you cannot maximize it again and have to manually exit the program and re-run it. This is a major bug and
needs to be fixed early on just so a user can comfortably use the program.

**Why do you think you will get them done? (details)**

> We chose User Stories that were a decent amount of work, but were still reasonable time-wise. Having a six-person team, we wanted enough
work for all of us to have 3-4 tasks to do. Some of the tasks will of course be more time-consuming than others, but they have all been created
and chosen with our short sprint timeframe in mind. 

**Do you have a rough idea what you need to do? (if the answer is no then please let me know on Slack)**

> We know exactly what we need to do. In this first sprint we are going to familiarize ourselves with the Memoranda program/codebase and start
to move forward with progress toward our chosen project. Our User Stories were chosen and created specifically because they are good starting points
for this project and are items that need to be taken care of early on.



## 2: During the Sprint
> Fill out the Meeting minutes during your Sprint and keep track of things. Update your Quality policies when needed, as explained in the lectures and in the Quality Policy documents on Canvas. 
I would also advise you to already fill out the Contributions section (End of sprint) as you go, to create less work at the end.

### Meeting minutes of your Daily Scrums (3 per week, should not take longer than 10 minutes):
> Add as many rows as needed and fill out the table. (Burndown starts with Sprint 2 and Travis CI starts with Sprint 3, not needed before that)

| Date  | Attendees  |Minutes   | Burndown Info | TravisCI info | Additional Info  |

## 3: After the Sprint

### Sprint Review

**Screen Cast link**: https://youtu.be/Y1wRqsc4tHM

> Answer the following questions as a team. 

**What do you think is the value you created this Sprint?**

> The value we created was focused on laying the ground work for future sprints. A lot of it was focused on planning/designing and becoming familiar with Memoranda.

**Do you think you worked enough and that you did what was expected of you?**

> We think that we did enough work but as a team we felt that we could have had more User Stories and Tasks. Also, focusing on separating the work loads better in the future amongst different User Stories.

**Would you say you met the customers’ expectations? Why, why not?**

> We met the customer's expectations because we defined the sprint goal, shared that goal with the customer, and finished that sprint goal as it was defined. We also added additional User Stories and accomplished those as well after running them with our customer.

### Sprint Retrospective

> Include your Sprint retrospective here and answer the following questions in an evidence based manner as a team (I do not want each of your individuals opinion here but the team perspective). By evidence-based manner it means I want a Yes or No on each of these questions, and for you to provide evidence for your answer. That is, don’t just say "Yes we did work at a consistent rate because we tried hard"; say "we worked at a consistent rate because here are the following tasks we completed per team member and the rate of commits in our Git logs."

**Did you meet your sprint goal?**

> Yes, we did meet the sprint goal. All tasks were completed.

**Did you complete all stories on your Sprint Backlog?**

> Yes, we completed all sprint User Stories.

**Did you work at a consistent rate of speed, or velocity? (Meaning did you work during the whole Sprint or did you start working when the deadline approached.)**

> By looking at our Taiga burndown chart and github commits, we had a consistent work flow and pace. Our Taiga burndown chart
shows a consistent declining chart, with very little horizontal spots, which indicates that we consistently worked every day and
met our goals by closing tasks/user stories.

**Did you deliver business value?**

> No, we did not generate physical value but we did progress closer to the software being a sellable product.

**Are there things the team thinks it can do better in the next Sprint?**

> We believe that we can include more stories and more evenly distribute Tasks amongst User Stories. Our tasks this sprint
were often closely related and sometimes even inter-connected, which made it difficult for multiple people to work on the same
user story. We would like to change this in future sprints and make tasks that do not depend on each other as much.

> In the future we want to include more indepth Acceptance Criteria for testing User Stories upon completion. 

> Do a better job at assessing user points for different User Stories so the workload is more evenly distributed.

**How do you feel at this point? Get a pulse on the optimism of the team.**

> We feel confident in our ability to accomplish assigned tasks and showed good time management.
