# Deliverable Information
   > Please include your answers below in a good format so it is easy for me to see. For answers to questions please use these Blockquotes. Make sure you also check the kickoff document for more details.

## 1: Basic Information (needed before you start with your Sprint -- Sprint Planning)

**Topic you chose:** Gym Scheduler

**Sprint Number:** 2

**Scrum Master**: Kelly Petrone

**Git Master**: Rita Barrilleaux

### Sprint Planning (For Sprint 1-4)
Document your Sprint Planning here. Also check the kickoff document for more details on what needs to be done. This is just the documentation. 

**Sprint Goal:** Focus on separating out the three types of user accounts, implementing the UI's/backend for each of those according to design documents, and eliminating any unused GUI elements from the previous Memoranda 

**How many User Stories did you add to the Product Backlog:**  10

**How many User Stories did you add to this Sprint:** 7

**Why did you add exactly these US?**

> We decided to create User Stories that worked toward our Sprint2 goal, which focused mainly on completing the front end GUI elements
of our program. The User Stories we added will help us in the future during Sprint3, when we will mainly have the backend to work
on, as well as putting the two together.

**Why do you think you will get them done? (details)**

> We spoke in depth about our time and work estimation this sprint, as well as how we managed our time last sprint. From this we
decided the amount of work in these User Stories is enough for us to complete this sprint, but not too much. We also took into account
the fact that we will have to unit test the work that we do.

**Do you have a rough idea what you need to do? (if the answer is no then please let me know on Slack)**

> Yes, we know what we need to do. We need to focus on getting the UI elements finished this sprint, as well as unit testing.



## 2: During the Sprint
> Fill out the Meeting minutes during your Sprint and keep track of things. Update your Quality policies when needed, as explained in the lectures and in the Quality Policy documents on Canvas. 
I would also advise you to already fill out the Contributions section (End of sprint) as you go, to create less work at the end.

### Meeting minutes of your Daily Scrums (3 per week, should not take longer than 10 minutes):
> Add as many rows as needed and fill out the table. (Burndown starts with Sprint 2 and Travis CI starts with Sprint 3, not needed before that)

## 3: After the Sprint

### Sprint Review

**Screen Cast link**: https://youtu.be/OASRYUmUpb4

**What do you think is the value you created this Sprint?**

> Accomplishing the initial schedule system in the UI was a big step forward towards meeting the requirements. The Login GUI also authenticates users. The team implemented a database and the program communicates with it to save and retreive data.

**Do you think you worked enough and that you did what was expected of you?**

> I think our team has gone far above the requirements or what was expected of us this sprint. Not that we accomplished tasks outside of the User Stories, but went further into the User Stories that we did initially develop. We also met most of the Tasks on our sprint log. We left a lot of room going into sprint 3 to focus on the smaller things and to implement different levels of accounts based on the requirements.

**Would you say you met the customersâ€™ expectations? Why, why not?**

> For the stories that we delivered on and completed we met all of the acceptance criteria, therefore meeting the customers expectations and requirements. There was one User Story that we did not finish, thus not meeting 100% of the established requirements this sprint.

### Sprint Retrospective

**Did you meet your sprint goal?**

> We met about 95% of our sprint goal. The only part of our sprint goal that we did not finish is the implementation of buttons on the Classes UI page. This was due to the time it took us to implement the classes page. Otherwise, we met all the elements of our sprint goal.

- Sprint Goal
   - Focus on separating out the three types of user accounts, implementing the UI's/backend for each of those according to design documents, and eliminating any unused GUI elements from the previous Memoranda  

**Did you complete all stories on your Spring Backlog?**

> We completely all but on story in the Sprint Backlog.

**If not, what went wrong?**

> One of the stories that we had in our sprint backlog, relied heavily on implementing the largest task of the sprint. If we had known this before hand, we likely would have saved this User Story for Sprint 3. There was a large learning curve going into Sprint 2 on how we were going to manipulate memoranda to meet our requirements which also played a role.

**Did you work at a consistent rate of speed, or velocity? (Meaning did you work during the whole Sprint or did you start working when the deadline approached.)**

> In general we followed the linear path expected for closing stories, as shown on our taiga board. We did slow down towards the end of the sprint as we started to narrow down the tasks remaining.

**Did you deliver business value?**

> We delivered on features that largely impact the customers ability to see classes and to manage user accounts in the system. They can view classes in a database but aren't yet able to join them. 

**Are there things the team thinks it can do better in the next Sprint?**

> Part way through the sprint we realized that we weren't pulling tasks into develop nearly enough. This caused issues with knowing how much progress people made on certain tasks. Also, initially we were waiting until a User Story was completely done to merge it in. This led to issues of overlap between different user stories. Also, we should narrow down the User Stories and have less tasks per User Story. 

**How do you feel at this point? Get a pulse on the optimism of the team.**

> We feel confident going into the final sprint to meet all of the User Requirements. We accomplished a large percentage of the requirements this sprint so we can produce a more polished product.

 **What was your main contribution to the Quality Policy documentation?:

    - Asked professor for permission to change some of the developer review checklist.  Now our checklist checks for 120 characters intead of 100.  We discussed changing the sentence about unit testing to check for testing where it makes sense, because some branches/commits are GUI related and dont make sense to require a test for review.
