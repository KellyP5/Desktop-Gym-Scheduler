# Deliverable Information
   > Please include your answers below in a good format so it is easy for me to see. For answers to questions please use these Blockquotes. Make sure you also check the kickoff document for more details.

## 1: Basic Information (needed before you start with your Sprint -- Sprint Planning)

**Topic you chose:** Gym Scheduler

**Sprint Number:** 3

**Scrum Master**: Kelly Ellis

**Git Master**: Alex Mack

### Sprint Planning (For Sprint 1-4)
Document your Sprint Planning here. Also check the kickoff document for more details on what needs to be done. This is just the documentation. 

**Sprint Goal:** Finish implementing GUI elements that we started last sprint, refactor parts of code that need synergy, and put the
finishing touches on everything.

**How many User Stories did you add to the Product Backlog:** 7

**How many User Stories did you add to this Sprint:** 6

> Answer the questions below about your Sprint Planning?

**Why did you add exactly these US?**

> Since this is our last sprint, we didn't have much of a choice of what to add other than User Stories that complete our project
goal. The User Stories that we added include all of the work that we had left over from the past 2 sprints.

**Why do you think you will get them done? (details)**

> We made a considerable amount of progress in Sprint2, which left us with a good amount of work to finish up the project for this sprint, so we are confident that the User Stories we made will get done.

**Do you have a rough idea what you need to do? (if the answer is no then please let me know on Slack)**

> Yes, we know how we want to wrap up our project and which finishing touches we need to add. Each team member also knows their 
individual responsibilities as far as testing, static analysis, and continuous integration.



## 2: During the Sprint
> Fill out the Meeting minutes during your Sprint and keep track of things. Update your Quality policies when needed, as explained in the lectures and in the Quality Policy documents on Canvas. 
I would also advise you to already fill out the Contributions section (End of sprint) as you go, to create less work at the end.

 **What was your main contribution to the Quality Policy documentation?:

    - As a team we decided to keep the majority of our Quality Policy the same for this sprint, and implemented
    our Continuous Integration and Static Analysis portions of our policy. We decided that it was reasonable for 
    each team member to fix 20 SA errors this sprint, and that we would all ensure that the develop and master
    branches always pass the Travis CI builds.
