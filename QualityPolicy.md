  We will maintain a develop branch, and code on our own independent branches. Once we have implemented a task, we will then merge it into develop 
  for per review(PR). Once develop has been updated, the team will be notified that they need to fetch and merge (git pull) the changes into thier
  local repositorys. Any merge conflicts will be handled by the current user performing the pull request, and if need be, the team will assist as
  needed.
