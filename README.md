### Globo Gym - Team Neujahrskranz
#### SER316 Spring 2020

Welcome to Globo Gym, the best gym scheduling app on the market.

To run this program, clone the github repository, open a command line, and use `gradle run`.

When the program runs you'll find yourself immersed in the glory that is Globo Gym's scheduling app. 

First, if you're a new user, please create an account for yourself via the Login screen's Create Account button.
Once your account is created and your user information is stored in the database, log in to the application with your new
credentials.

Once logged in, you'll find yourself landing on the Classes page. This page shows you a list of all classes being held
in the gym for the current day. To see past classes or future classes, use the calendar on the top left to navigate to a
different day. The classes are held in 4 different rooms, as shown in the Classes page. Green classes are open to more students
enrolling, and red classes are full. As a user you can use the buttons on the top of the Classes page to enroll in a class, schedule a class, or edit a class.

To navigate to the Agenda page, click the `Agenda` icon in the top left corner. This page shows you your schedule of classes
that you're enrolled in or are teaching for the current day. Again, to see the schedule of a different day, use the calendar in the top left.

For user convenience, the Notes page allows you to take and keep notes on anything your heart desires.

The last page in the program is the User Management page. This page shows every user currently stored in Globo Gym's database.
Admins can add new users, remove old users, or edit current users' information on this page.

Have fun using Globo Gym!
